King, MD; Andrew J. Knighton, PhD; Erica Lake, MLS; Susan Murin, MD; Janine R. E. Vintch, MD; Philip S. Wells, MD; and Lisa K. Moores, MD\n\nBACKGROUND: This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.\n\nMETHODS: We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.\n\nRESULTS: The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modi /uniFB01 ed from the 1st update.\n\nCONCLUSION: New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.\n\nCHEST 2021; 160(6):2247-2259\n\nKEY WORDS: antithrombotic therapy; DVT; guidelines; pulmonary embolism; thrombosis\n\nABBREVIATIONS: AC = anticoagulation; APS = antiphospholipid syndrome; ASH = American Society of Hematology; AT9 = Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines; CAT = cancer-associated thrombosis; CDT = catheter-directed thrombolysis; CVT = cerebral vein thrombosis; DOAC = direct-acting oral anticoagulant; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; EtD = evidence-to-decision; ISSPE = isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism; IVC = inferior vena cava; LMWH = low-molecular-weight heparin; NICE = National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; PE = pulmonary embolism; PICO = Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome; PTS = postthrombotic syndrome; SVT = super /uniFB01 cial venous thrombosis; VKA = vitamin K antagonist\n\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Department of Medicine (S.

In patients with acute isolated distal DVT of the leg and (i) without severe symptoms or risk factors for extension (see text), we suggest serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks over anticoagulation (weak recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence); or (ii) with severe symptoms or risk factors for extension (see text), we suggest anticoagulation over serial imaging of the deep veins (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence).\n- 2. In patients with acute isolated distal DVT of the leg who are treated with serial imaging, we (i) recommend no anticoagulation if the thrombus does not extend (strong recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence), (ii) suggest anticoagulation if the thrombus extends but remains con /uniFB01 ned to the distal veins (weak recommendation, very low-certainty evidence), and (iii) recommend anticoagulation if the thrombus extends into the proximal veins (strong recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence).\n\nRemarks: Serial imaging refers to repeating ultrasound once weekly, or with worsening symptoms, for 2 weeks and anticoagulating only if distal thrombi propagate. Patients at high risk for bleeding are more likely to bene /uniFB01 t from serial imaging. Evidence suggests uncertainty that anticoagulation is superior to no anticoagulation. Patients who place a high value on avoiding the inconvenience of repeat imaging and a low value on the inconvenience of treatment and on the potential for bleeding are likely to favor initial anticoagulation over serial imaging.\n\nIn patients with acute isolated distal DVT of the leg who are managed with anticoagulation, the same anticoagulation regimen as for patients with acute proximal should be used.\n\n## Selected summary of /uniFB01 ndings:\n\n- Y Recurrent VTE at 3 months: 60 fewer events per 1,000 cases (from 77 fewer to 21 fewer)\n- 4 Major bleeding at 3 months: 2 fewer events per 1,000 cases (from 7 fewer to 29 more)\n- 4 Overall mortality at 3 months: 0 fewer events per 1,000 cases (from 0 fewer to 0 more)\n\nComments: Isolated distal DVT is de /uniFB01 ned as thrombus affecting deep veins of the lower extremity with most proximal extent distal to the popliteal vein. The key management decision when isolated distal DVT is diagnosed is whether to offer anticoagulation or perform serial ultrasound (weekly for 2 weeks or with worsening symptoms) and offer anticoagulation only if proximal propagation is observed. Several factors that encapsulate patient preference and risk in /uniFB02 uence this decision, further detailed in the online supplement to this guideline [https://journal.chestnet.org/ article/S0012-3692(21)01506-3/fulltext].\n\n## Other guidelines:\n\n2018 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline: No speci /uniFB01 c guidance. 5\n\n2020 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline: Recommendations for only proximal DVT. 6\n\nWhether to Treat Isolated Subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism\n\nPICO Question: Should anticoagulant therapy vs no anticoagulant therapy be given to patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism?:\n\n## Guidance statement:\n\n- 3. In patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) (no involvement of more proximal pulmonary arteries) and no proximal DVT in the legs\n\nwho have a (i) low risk for recurrent VTE (see text), we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence) or (ii) high risk for recurrent VTE (see text), we suggest anticoagulation over clinical surveillance (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence).\n\nComments: Because isolated subsegmental PE (ISSPE) is associated with DVT, the panel endorsed excluding proximal DVT with bilateral leg ultrasound, or at another location if clinically suspected (eg, upper extremity if DVT is suspected), before choosing to withhold anticoagulation for ISSPE.

malignancies who place higher value on avoiding GI major bleeding, whereas others may elect the convenience of oncedaily DOAC therapy (edoxaban or rivaroxaban).However, LMWHhas the potential

Although historically considered a benign disease, more recent appreciation of the seriousness of SVT has informed treatment studies. The anticoagulants fondaparinux and rivaroxaban 10 mg orally once daily for 45 days prevent progression of SVT, DVT, PE, or death among select patients with SVT. 27 Factors that favor the use of anticoagulation for the treatment of SVT include extensive SVT; involvement above the knee, particularly if close to the saphenofemoral junction; severe symptoms; involvement of the greater saphenous vein; history of VTE or SVT; active cancer; and recent surgery.\n\n## Other guidelines:\n\nNo recent evidence-based guidelines for management of SVT were identi /uniFB01 ed.\n\nA review commissioned by the American Society of Hematology s Education Program included a ' management algorithm that suggested either fondaparinux or rivaroxaban in selected patients with more extensive SVT, risk factors for VTE, and no contraindications to anticoagulant therapy. 26\n\n## Duration of Anticoagulation in Patients With Acute VTE\n\nPICO Question: Should extended-phase anticoagulant therapy vs no extended-phase anticoagulant therapy be provided to patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed the treatment phase of therapy?:\n\nGuidance statements:\n\nDuration of Treatment Phase of Anticoagulation\n\n21.

While extended-phase therapy is de /uniFB01 ned as having no planned stop date, the longest duration of follow up to assess outcomes was about four years. Although participants in these trials generally did not discontinue anticoagulants at the conclusion of follow-up, the risk-to-bene /uniFB01 t balance of continuing anticoagulants beyond this period is less certain.
